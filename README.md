## 🧠 How It Works

- The board is a 3x3 grid of buttons.
- Player X and O alternate turns.
- Each move displays the player's symbol:
  - 🔴 **X** in red
  - 🔵 **O** in blue
- If a player wins, a fullscreen popup shows the winner and a "Start" button.
- You can also reset the game anytime with the **Reset** button.
